- <a href="https://plantpathology.unl.edu/nikita-gambhir"> Nikita Gambhir</a>, Doctoral student, August 2015 to **present**. Nikita's doctoral research is in genome analysis of *S. sclerotiorum* mutational lines. She is also characterizing the population structure and fungicide sensitivity *Rhizoctonia zeae* that she has collected from Nebraska.

- <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Edgar_Nieto_Lopez2"> Edgar H. Nieto-Lopez</a>, Doctoral student, August 2016 to **present**. Edgar is conducting a project to assess fungicide sensitivity and population structure of *S. sclerotiorum* from soybean, potato, and dry bean in the North Central States and Mexico. This is much needed work to improve our understanding of the basic epidemiology of this pathogen.

- Karen F. Da Silva, Doctoral student, June 2018 to **present**. Karen joined the lab with an ongoing project to improve out understanding of the *Clavibacter michiganensis* pv. *nebraskensis* interaction with the fall armyworm on corn. Within my lab, she has developed a project to survey of leadership needs and training of graduate students in the agSTEM sciences and will be conducting a meta-analysis of previous *S. sclerotiorum* population genetic studies.
