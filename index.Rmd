### News from 2019

#### August 2019
  - After 5 years at the University of Nebraska, I will be starting this fall semester as an associate professor in the Department of Plant Pathology. To the best of my knowledge, I am the third woman to be hired and promoted in the department in the 100 year history, following the footsteps of Drs. Anne Vidaver and Tamra Jackson-Ziems. For those who may be on the tenure track and wondering what a tenure package looks like, you are welcome to <a href="documents/Everhart_PnT_Dossier_12-21-2018.pdf">view mine here.</a>
  - Several of the Everhart Lab members traveled to the APS Meeting in Cleveland, OH to present our research. Karen presented two talks, including one in the Melhus Symposium. Margarita presented two posters (although I had to present one on her behalf because of the time conflict). Nikita presented two posters and co-taught our Intro R workshop. Srikanth presented a poster of his research.  Thomas presented a poster of previous work in my lab and even Edgar had a poster at the meeting, which I presented on his behalf. In general, we made our visit to Ohio very productive, forming new relationships, extending our networks, and identifying future potential collaborations. 
  - Congratulations to Karen!  She received the third place oral presentation from the North Central Division and was the only student from our department selected for the NC-APS travel award. Way to go!
  - A big welcome to new Everhart Lab member, Mr. Sergio Gabriel-Peralta!  Sergio received his bachelor's in Mexico and his master's at UNL studying viruses. He joins the lab after having been awarded a prestigious CONNACYT fellowship from the Mexican government.  Welcome, Sergio!
  
#### July 2019
  - Congratulations, Julianne, for successfully defending your dissertation!  I heard lots of great comments about the quality of your presentation.
  - Julianne was awarded the Corteva Award to attend the Society of Nematology (SON) Meeting in Raleigh, NC this month.  She gave an oral presentation of her research on nematodes in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park and presented a poster of her work on deciphering ecological features within cryptic species, *Mesocriconema xenoplax*.
  - The beginning of this month was the conclusion of a summer course that I taught on professional development called *Success in the Sciences*. This has become a highly rated course and so I will be teaching it again this fall.
  - In other news, Ms. Asha Mane is joiing the Everhart Lab this month.  Asha received her bachelor's and master's in India and is interested in cutting-edge research in plant pathology. She also comes to us after having several years of lab experience. We will be working together this fall to develop her project plans. Welcome, Asha!

#### June 2019
  - I traveled with Complex Biosystems students, Kimberly Stanke and Ashley Stengel, to Idaho to present a poster and for them to give talks at the North American Colleges and Teachers of Agriculture meeting in Twin Falls, ID. Congratulations on two very excellent presentations on pedagogy!


#### April 2019
  - We have two new people joining the Everhart Lab this month, Mr. Srikanth Kodati and Ms. Gulcin Ercan.  Both students previously worked with Dr. Tony Adesemoye who left UNL for an industry position this month. Srikanth will move to Lincoln later this spring and Gulcin will finish her master's in North Platte, under direct supervision of her co-advisor, Dr. Julie Peterson. Welcome, Sri and Gulcin!

#### March 2019
  - The Everhart Lab hosted Dr. Lucky Mehra, epidemiologist and instructor from Kansas State University to give a seminar and co-teach the Intro to R workshop during the spring break to more than 60 students, staff, and faculty.  
  - Nikita and I traveled to Knoxville, TN to the University of Tennessee for a joint collaborative visit with Drs. Denita Hadziabdic and Meg Staton. We kicked off a week-long visit by teaching our Intro R workshop and then later, Nikita worked with the Staton lab to learn de novo genome assembly and I worked one-on-one in a data analysis project with Denita. 
  - Good news!  I returned from Tennessee to find out that my application for tenure and promotion were officially approved at all of the levels from the department to the Vice Chancellor.

#### February 2019
  - The UNL Teaching and Learning Symposium was held this month at Innovation Campus. As part of the event, I co-taught a workshop on active learning techniques that were used in my professional development course. The great thing was that I got to co-teach this with two graduate students who co-developed the course, Kimberly Stanke and Ashley Stengel. I think we did a great job and had fun!

#### January 2019
  - Biochemistry undergraduate, Cristian Wolkup-Gil, has joined our lab to gain research experience. He's writing proposals for  a UCARE project and an IANR Undergraduate Research Award to conduct a project on fungicide sensitivity of *Sclerotinia sclerotiorum* from dry bean fields in the U.S. 
  = The project that I started as part of my USDA-NIFA Postdoctoral fellowship on *Phytophthora ramorum* was published in *mBio* this month. 
  - As part of my application for tenure, I delivered a seminar in the Department of Plant Pathology this month that highlighted my research and its impact.


### News from 2018


#### December 2018
  - Starting in the spring, Ms. Julianne Matcynszyn will join the Everhart Lab to complete her Ph.D., which is on the ecological differnatiation within *Mesocriconema xenoplax* cryptic species. She comes to our lab after four years in Tom Powers' lab.  Julianne is targeting August for completion of her dissertation. Welcome, Julianne!
  - This month, I finalized and submitted my application for early tenure consideraton in the Department of Plant Pathology. Since there is no third year review in our department and no penalty for going up a year early for tenure consideration, I considered this a "no brainer". In the worst case scenario, this will allow me to gain feedback on what I need to do this year to make a winning application next year.
  
#### Fall 2018
  - This was a particularly difficult fall semester with the unexpected loss of graduate student, Eddie Hillman.  Eddie was a student in my course this past spring and during the summer.  There really are no words that can express what a loss this is to our department and our science.

#### July 2018

  - Several of us took a trip to Boston for the combined meeting of the International Congress of Plant Pathology (ICPP) and the American Phytopathological Society, where one workshop, one talk, and several posters will be presented by members of our group.
  - Workshop: Intro to R for Plant Pathologists was co-taught with Nikita to >60 attendees 
  - Talk: Nikita gave a presentation in a special session on fungicide resistance to a large audience
  - The 8-week summer semester teaching *Success in the Sciences* has finally come to an end and, after a week of recovery, Ashley, Kimberly, and I have decided that our work to develop this coures will be documented as a Benchmark Portfolio to be published on UNL Digital Commons, shared in Canvas to enable others to import the course, and we will analyze artifacts of our course in order to summarize the work for publication in a journal like *North American College Teachers in Agriculture*. 


#### June 2018

- The Everhart Lab is headed to Fargo, ND this June to attend the APS North Central Division Meeting. Among abstracts submitted, Edgar's was selected for a prestigious oral presentation. He will be presenting a talk entitled, "Fungicide sensitivity of 42 Sclerotinia sclerotiorum isolates in the North Central U.S. and determination of discriminatory concentrations."

<br>
![](images/Karen Ferreira Da Silva.jpg "Karen Ferreira Da Silva joins Everhart Lab"){.custom_image .shadow .grow}

- Joining the Everhart Lab is Karen Ferreira Da Silva. Karen comes to us with research experience working in the labs of Drs. Gary Yuen and Josh Herr, and having received her M.S. in Entomology working with Dr. Blair Sigfreid. Projects that Karen will complete in my lab include a meta-analysis of gene expression data, a greenhouse study to evaluate interactions in the corn root worm x Goss's wild pathogen on disease development, and a survey of leadership training provided to and needed for students in Plant Pathology and the broader agricultural STEM careers. Welcome Karen!



#### May 2018

  - We are welcoming two new people to our lab this summer!  Callie Braley and Rahchel Persson. 
  - Callie is a student in the Doctor of Plant Health program and will be spending time learning about how research on fungicide sensitivity is conducted in the lab. She will also begin a small survey of Nebraska to see if she finds any QoI-resistant isolates of the frogeye leaf spot pathogen *Cercospora sojina*. 
  ![](images/RachelPersson.jpeg "Rachel Persson joins Everhart Lab"){.custom_imagesm .shadow .grow}
  - Rachel is an undergraduate student in biochemistry and received funding from the UNL UCARE program to conduct a small study where she will be comparing genotyping results from the Steadman Lab *Sclerotinia sclerotiorum* database to genotyping results in our lab in order to determine if genotyping results of the two can be compared and combined.
  - This summer I'll be teaching a new course in professional development, entitled *Success in the Sciences*. The fun part is that this is a coures that I am co-developing wtih two graduate students in the Complex Biosystems program, Kimberley Stanke and Ashley Stengel, with additional guidance on curriculum development and active learning techniques from Dr. Sydney Brown.
