In my lab, we characterize population dynamics and spread of fungal plant pathogens using quantitative spatiotemporal epidemiology, population genetics, and whole-genome approaches. We also study how pathogens evolve under stress and how this is related to emergence of fungicide resistance.

#### February 2019
  
  - The UNL Teaching and Learning Symposium was held this month at the Nebraska Innovation Campus. As part of the event, I co-taught a workshop on active learning techniques that were used in my professional development course. The great thing was that I got to co-teach this with two graduate students who co-developed the course, **Kimberly Stanke** and **Ashley Stengel**. I think we did a great job and had fun!

  - This month, I finalized and submitted my application for early tenure consideraton in the Department of Plant Pathology. Since there is no third year review in our department and no penalty for going up a year early for tenure consideration, I considered this a "no brainer". In the worst case scenario, this will allow me to gain feedback on what I need to do this year to make a winning application next year.
  
#### November 2018
  
  - Invited by **Dr. David Cook** of the Department of Plant Pathology, I visited Kansas State University to give a seminar.
