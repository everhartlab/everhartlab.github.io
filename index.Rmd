In my lab, we characterize population dynamics and spread of fungal plant pathogens using quantitative spatiotemporal epidemiology, population genetics, and whole-genome approaches. We also study how pathogens evolve under stress and how this is related to emergence of fungicide resistance.

## News from the Lab

<br> 

### November 2017
- Our population study of *Sclerotinia sclerotiorum* populations is now accepted for publication in *PeerJ*!  Congratulations to Zhian *et al.* on this publication!
- New undergraduate students, Audrey Vega and Isabel Chavez, are selected to join the Everhart Lab as new lab helpers.  Welcome, Audrey and Isabel!
- The USDA Women and Minorities in Agricultural STEM program will be funding a project that I co-developed with collaborators Jenny Keshwani, Leah Sandall, Julie Obermyer, and Deepak Keshwani, to create a mentoring program for youth to connect with career professionals who look like them.  Our program is called *Cultivate ACCESS* and will be launched in the spring of 2018!

#### October 2017
- Invited by Dr. Anne Dorrance, I taught our Intro to R for Plant Pathologists workshop to ~20 grad students and postdocs located in Wooster and video-linked to Columbus.  The following day, I gave a seminar for the department and had a great time meeting students, faculty, and staff.
- Our manuscript on the largest population genetic study of *Sclerotinia sclerotiorum* that were collected over a 10-year period is now out as a *PeerJ Preprints* and under review at *PeerJ*.
- Jimin Kamvar has joined the Department of Plant Pathology to serve as a *Digital Communications Liaison*. Her work will me keep the department website much more timely and updated.  Welcome, Jimin!

#### September 2017

- I was invited by Dr. Mark Gleason to give a seminar at the Department of Plant Pathology and Microbiology at Iowa State University.
- Nikita was selected to receive the 2017-2018 Widaman Distinguished Graduate Assistantship. Congratulations, Nikita!

#### August 2017

- Invited by Drs. Eduardo Mizubuti and David Jaccoud Filho, I gave two presentations at the 16th International Sclerotinia Workshop in Uberlandia, Brazil. This also included a post-meeting field trip to see agricultural production in the region and my first visit to a coffee plantation (with rust!!).
- Edgar, Zhian, Thomas, Nikita, and I are headed to the national APS meeting in San Antonio, TX.  Check out our posters if you're there.
- Nikita received the Donald E. Munnecke Student Travel Award from APS to attend the national meeting.  Well done!

#### July 2017

- Farewell to Anthony as he departs the Everhart Lab to begin graduate studies in microbiology at the University of Iowa.  Good luck, Anthony!
- Welcome to Alex Johnson!  Starting in July, Alex will be working in our lab half time as a research assistant.
