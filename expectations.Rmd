#### Work Hours, Face Time, Sick Leave, and Vacation Time
*November 22, 2017*

<br>
  
### Work hours
Graduate research assistantships (GRAs) are part-time salaried positions that expect 19.6 hours of work per week during the academic year and for 40 hours per week during academic breaks and summer sessions.  Additional time directed towards research is expected when enrolled in credit hours for research and/or thesis/dissertation writing.  Because a GRA is a salaried position, these work hours are the expectation and not recorded on a time sheet.  The actual amount of time spent on research can vary considerably.  You are expected to manage your time effectively.  Poor time management at the beginning of a graduate program can be especially damaging because **even as little as 10 minutes per day spent off task adds up to more than a week of time lost by the end of the year**.  Now, consider what an opportunity that time offers!  If you spend just 10 minutes per day on writing your first manuscript, you’ll have spent more than an entire 40-hour work week by the end of the first year.

### Face time
Students should develop strategies for optimal productivity.  Graduate students in my lab are allowed to work from home or any other place that allows them increased productivity.  However, there are benefits to being seen and present in our department on a regular basis (this is called “face time”).  Colleagues and faculty will notice if you are in the building daily and working hard.  Being present in the department will also increase opportunities for collaboration and enable you to learn from others.  Naturally, newer students will be present at the department more often than those who have only the thesis or dissertation left to complete.  However, being present without being productive is not a good use of time and will not lead to benefits.  For this reason, it is your responsibility to set a work schedule for yourself that will maximize both productivity and visibility.

### Sick leave
I do not expect you to work while you are sick.  It’s better to stay home and recover.  You should notify me via email if you will be out of the office due to illness.  If longer periods of leave are needed, such as for family/child illness, medical issues, or funeral leave, please let me know so we can discuss a plan for your work to avoid setbacks.

### Requesting vacation time 
Time off for vacation requires my approval beforehand.  Approval of requests for vacation will be based upon successful performance of job duties, grades, expectations, and progress towards completion of your research projects.  Additional time off will be granted for exceptional performance.

<br>

**General guidelines for vacation time** – It is unlikely for you to receive approval of a request for more vacation time than an employee with a full-time 12-month appointment would accumulate.  For example, in the 1st through 5th year of employment, full-time employees accrue one vacation day per month. Thus, a person who began employment on August 15th would accrue four vacation days by December 15th.  This time can be combined with UNL holidays (when UNL is closed) for a total time off of 2-weeks during the winter break.  This amount of vacation during the winter holiday assumes no vacation days were taken prior to the winter holiday.  The following year, it would be possible to take up to 3 weeks off during the winter break.  Since time during academic breaks, winter holiday, and summers offer the opportunity and expectation to complete more research (40 hours per week), taking this time off can be costly to your research progress and classes should not be skipped for vacation.
