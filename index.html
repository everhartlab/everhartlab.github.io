<h4>August 2019</h4>
<ul>
<li>After 5 years at the University of Nebraska, I will be starting this fall semester as an associate professor in the Department of Plant Pathology. To the best of my knowledge, I am the third woman to be hired and promoted in the department in the 100 year history, following the footsteps of Drs. Anne Vidaver and Tamra Jackson-Ziems. For those who may be on the tenure track and wondering what a tenure package looks like, you are welcome to <a href="documents/Everhart_PnT_Dossier_12-21-2018.pdf">open the PDF here.</a></li>
<li>Several of the Everhart Lab members traveled to the APS Meeting in Cleveland, OH to present our research. Karen presented two talks, including one in the Melhus Symposium. Margarita presented two posters (although I had to present one on her behalf because of the time conflict). Nikita presented two posters and co-taught our Intro R workshop. Srikanth presented a poster of his research. Thomas presented a poster of previous work in my lab and even Edgar had a poster at the meeting, which I presented on his behalf. In general, we made our visit to Ohio very productive, forming new relationships, extending our networks, and identifying future potential collaborations.</li>
<li>Congratulations to Karen! She received the third place oral presentation from the North Central Division and was the only student from our department selected for the NC-APS travel award. Way to go!</li>
<li>A big welcome to new Everhart Lab member, Mr. Sergio Gabriel-Peralta! Sergio received his bachelor’s in Mexico and his master’s at UNL studying viruses. He joins the lab after having been awarded a prestigious CONNACYT fellowship from the Mexican government. Welcome, Sergio!</li>

<h4>December 2018</h4>
<ul>
<li>Starting in the spring, Ms. Julianne Matcynszyn will join the Everhart Lab to complete her Ph.D., which is on the ecological differnatiation within <em>Mesocriconema xenoplax</em> cryptic species. She comes to our lab after four years in Tom Powers’ lab. Julianne is targeting August for completion of her dissertation. Welcome, Julianne!</li>
<li>This month, I finalized and submitted my application for early tenure consideraton in the Department of Plant Pathology. Since there is no third year review in our department and no penalty for going up a year early for tenure consideration, I considered this a “no brainer”. In the worst case scenario, this will allow me to gain feedback on what I need to do this year to make a winning application next year.</li>
</ul>
