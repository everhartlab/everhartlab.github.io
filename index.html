<p>In my lab, we characterize population dynamics and spread of fungal plant pathogens using quantitative spatiotemporal epidemiology, population genetics, and whole-genome approaches. We also study how pathogens evolve under stress and how this is related to emergence of fungicide resistance.</p>

<li><p>Biochemistry undergraduate, <strong>Cristian Wolkup-Gil</strong>, has joined our lab to gain research experience. He’s writing proposals for a UCARE project and an IANR Undergraduate Research Award to conduct a project on fungicide sensitivity of <em>Sclerotinia sclerotiorum</em> from dry bean fields in the U.S. = The project that I started as part of my USDA-NIFA Postdoctoral fellowship on <em>Phytophthora ramorum</em> was published in <em>mBio</em> this month.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>Starting in the spring, <strong>Julianne Matcynszyn</strong> will join the Everhart Lab to complete her Ph.D., which is on the ecological differnatiation within <em>Mesocriconema xenoplax</em> cryptic species. She comes to our lab after four years in <strong>Dr. Tom Powers’</strong> lab. <strong>Julianne</strong> is targeting August for completion of her dissertation. Welcome, Julianne!</p></li>
<li><p>This month, I finalized and submitted my application for early tenure consideraton in the Department of Plant Pathology. Since there is no third year review in our department and no penalty for going up a year early for tenure consideration, I considered this a “no brainer”. In the worst case scenario, this will allow me to gain feedback on what I need to do this year to make a winning application next year.</p></li>

It was a very special moment for me to be invited to give a seminar in the place where my dad, <strong>Dr. Eldon Everhart</strong>, earned his B.S. and M.S. in Horticulture working with <strong>Dr. Charlie Hall</strong> in the 1960’s.</li>

<li><p><strong>Callie</strong> is a student in the Doctor of Plant Health program and will be spending time learning about how research on fungicide sensitivity is conducted in the lab.

<li><p>This summer I’ll be teaching a new course in professional development, entitled <em>Success in the Sciences</em>.
